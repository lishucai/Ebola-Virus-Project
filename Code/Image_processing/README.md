Images_statistics is the code that we used to learn about opencv. It is the first version of our code. 
images1.2 is a more advanced code. It gets all the files from a folder, and checks the file type. If it's a tiff file it makes some image processing, if it's a csv it gets the value, creat a histogram and print some statistics data.
