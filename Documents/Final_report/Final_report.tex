	\section{Introduction}
	
	This project was requested by Bill Smart, who is working with NIH and Doctors without borders. It was requested to try and use another method for checking patients for Ebola. A new method is important, as Ebola is transferred through bodily fluids, so the less contact doctors and other patients have with each other the less likely it will spread. The team that worked on this project were Claude Maimon, Bianca Beachamp, and Brian Huang. Claude was responsible for working on the image analysis, Bianca was responsible for working on the model creation and testing, and Brian was responsible for the final production mode and user interface. For this project our client was Bill Smart, we had weekly check ins with him and he would provide advice and troubleshooting. We also worked with several graduate students along with our TA Andrew Emmott.

	\subsection{Old Requirement Document}

	\subsection{New Requirements}
	There were two main things that we changed in the requirement documents. The first was the 40 percent success rate. From the initial research that we did, we found that some previous attempts of this approach produced about 40 percent success rate. When we started the project we thought that we could achieve that success rate. However, as we'll discuss in this report, we ran into many problems with the camera. The camera wasn't calibrated right and it returned bad values. We tried many things to fix it even though it is not in our requirements to try and fix the camera. When first writing this document, we assumed the camera would be working correctly. Since that wasn't the case, we had a hard time collecting good data. That's why we took out the 40 percent  success rate goal. Our client, Bill Smart, agreed with this change. Another change that we made was producing a report and not a research paper as a final product with the code. Our client agreed that there is no need for a research paper. We just needed to produce a report that will help his graduate students in continuing this project.

	\subsection{New Design Changes}
		The main change that we did in the design document is the same as the requirement change. We changed the final product from a research paper to a detailed report. Our client agreed that there is no need for a research paper. Instead, we produced a detailed report that can assist someone in continuing our project in the future.

	\section{Conclusions and Reflections}
	
	\subsection{Brian}
	For this project I worked on the production mode, the user interface and the evaluation method. The production mode required the uses of a linux machine, so I learned how to install linux onto my computer. It was a lot of trial and error messing with the BIOS, but I finally got it to work. I also learned about the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, what it does, what it looks for and how it works. This was used to create the evaluation method of the project. This piece is working, but it just needs data to be used. 
	
	After working on this project I learned that project work can be even more difficult than working alone, but if done correctly it can also be much easier. If the team communicates and cooperates with each other, the project can be done quickly and easily as there are more people thinking about the same problem, effectively doubling or tripling the problem solving power. However the key here is good communication and cooperation, if these are bad then the group work can become much more difficult than if worked on my a single person. The management of the project works exactly the same way, where communication and cooperation are extremely essential. Without communication one person ends up doing all of the work by themselves, where other group members may have been willing to share the load. Overall working in teams is definitely more difficult than working alone. It requires a lot of juggling of other group members workload and schedules. It becomes a balancing act of trying to keep everyone as happy as possible, as having a disgruntled team member can cause many problems.
	
	If I could do this whole project over again I would definitely start everything earlier than I did. Although everything got done on time, starting everything earlier would help reduce the stress we had over the three terms, as we would have more room to work on it. 
	
	\subsection{Claude}
	In this project, I worked on image process. Through the process, I improved my python skills. I haven't used Python much before and it was a great opportunity to learn more about the language. I also used an IDE (PyCharm) to debug my program. It showed me how easy it is to debug with the right tool. Lastly, I learned a lot about GitHub. I've used it before but through this project, I learned how to really use it. Other than these tools I also learned a lot about communicating with teammates, clients, and professors. I was kind of the manager of the team and I learned a lot from that experience.  Before this project, I used to always be the quiet person who just follows. Now I'm much more confident in sounding my opinion and leading a team.  
	
	This project taught me a lot about project work. All the paperwork that we’ve done Fall term really helped to organize the project. The organization made our requirements clear and helped us set a timeline. This timeline was a good start but of course, it changed a lot over the course of the project. I’ve learned a lot from our client, Professor Bill Smart. He showed us that many times a quick email will be better than a 30 minutes appointment. He also reassured us when things weren’t going the way they were supposed to. He gave us a chance to experience a real industry project. 
	
	As for teamwork, I’ve learned that a project can be easy working with the right people but can be difficult if the team doesn’t work well together.  A team project can give people the opportunity to step up or to push their work aside until someone else picks it up. Communication is really important in a team project. If I could do this year all over again, I would probably try to create a team and choose a project instead of leaving it to chance. I would also try and make a schedule for every assignment, so they won’t be done last minute. Lastly, I would try to have scheduled team meetings every week. a
