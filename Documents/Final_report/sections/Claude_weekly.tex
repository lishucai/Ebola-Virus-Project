\subsection*{Fall}
\subsubsection*{Week1}
	This week I read through all of the project proposals and chose my top choices. 
\subsubsection*{Week2}
	This week we received our project topic. We emailed our client to introduce ourselves and set up a time to meet with him. I also worked on the problem statement assignment. 
\subsubsection*{Week3}
	I finished my individual problem statement. My group and I met with our client on Friday for the first time. We also met with our TA on Friday. 
\subsubsection*{Week4}
	This week my team and I worked on the final problem statement.  We met with our client and redefined our final solution. We understood that this is a proof of concept project and the solution might not work. We are going to test this approach and do our best to figure out if we can estimate the core body temperature from the images. 
\subsubsection*{Week5}
	This week we focused on our project's requirements. We started writing them down but we noticed that we didnâ€™t have enough information. When we met with our client, he helped us with defining more requirements for the project. We discussed the camera the mechanical team is going to use and the tools we should use to learn how to process the images from the camera. 
\subsubsection*{Week6}
	This week we worked on our requirement  document. It was really helpful to focus on that because it gave us a better understanding on the project. Now it is clearer what the final product needs to be. We still need some more clarification from the client but overall we understand our project better now.
\subsubsection*{Week7}
	We've divided the project to three parts and each person it responsible to write on one. I will be responsible to working on the image processing part. I will need to cut the person from the image, and process the pixels out. I've been researching different technology options to do this. 
\subsubsection*{Week8}
	This week I finished the tech review document. It was helpful to look into the different technologies and learn more about image processing. It showed me that there were so many resources for image processing. 
\subsubsection*{Week9}
	This week was Thanksgiving week so I there wasn't a lot of time to get stuff done. I worked on fixing and finishing up my tech review document. I also started working on my design document draft. 
\subsubsection*{Week10}
	This week we met with Bill and Andrew to discuss some of our problems with the project. We weren't sure if we could meet the reequipments for the project in time so we had to redefine it.  
	

\subsection*{Winter}
\subsubsection*{Week1}
	First week of Winter term. We finished all of our documents from Fall term and started processing thermal images from the camera. 
\subsubsection*{Week2}
	We met with the mechanical team to talk about where we are in the project and what they've been up to. They will provide us a distance of which the camera will be positioned at. This way we will know how to take our images for now. We also decided that we need to start working on the AI part of the project.  
\subsubsection*{Week3}
	
\subsubsection*{Week4}

\subsubsection*{Week5}
	Started working on the report and the poster. Got some progress with the camera, finally got some good readings. Met with Andrew to talk about our progress and about the model. Bill gave us some ideas for the model part. Over all we're making progress. 
\subsubsection*{Week6}

\subsubsection*{Week8}
\subsubsection*{Week9}
	This week was really busy for all of us so we didn't make much progress.
\subsubsection*{Week10}
	This week we worked on taking new images to get data for the model. Unfortunately, after taking the images, we notices that the csv values are still off. They are higher than they are supposed to be. I emailed Chris, the graduate student, to try to work on this but I don't know if we we'll get it done by the end of the term. 
	
\subsection*{Spring}

\subsubsection*{Week1}
	
\subsubsection*{Week2}
	This week we divided the responsibilities that we have left. I am going to go over the documents and see what we need to change. Bianca will try to finish the poster. Brian will do the production mode.
\subsubsection*{Week3}
	We met with Bill this week. He said the document changes are fine and that the poster is fine. He said there will be a graduate student that will try to collect some data for us.
